# Java Core Practice 🚀

A repository showcasing Java core programming exercises, mini-projects and small console applications.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Practice **Java fundamentals** and problem-solving
- Apply **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts in real examples
- Work with **Collections, I/O, Exceptions**
- Write modular and maintainable code
- Gain confidence in building apps from scratch

## 📂 Mini Projects

Each folder contains a standalone console application:

- **BMI Calculator** – calculates Body Mass Index with input validation
- **Calculator** – basic arithmetic operations with validation service
- **Client Explorer** – reads data from `.csv`, allows simple client search & filtering
- **Diary** – console note-taking app with file persistence
- **Guess Game** – number guessing game with randomized logic
- **Hangman** – word guessing game with dictionary file support
- **Library** – book repository with search, add/remove, and exception handling
- **Quiz App** – simple quiz system with multiple-choice questions
- **Restaurant** – simulates menu, orders, and payments in a console environment
- **To-Do List** – manage tasks interactively via console

## 📦 Project Structure
Each project has a consistent structure:
- `Main` – entry point
- `App` – high-level orchestration
- `Service` – core business logic
- `ConsoleHandler` – user interaction
- Helpers (e.g., `Validator`, `FileManager`, `Repository`, `*Option` enum-like types)

👉 Full directory tree available here: [PROJECT_TREE.txt](PROJECT_TREE.txt)

## ▶️ How to Run
- **IDE**: Open the repo in IntelliJ/VS Code and run the `*Main` class inside a chosen project folder.
- **CLI** (example for `bmi`):
  ```bash
  javac bmi/*.java
  java bmi.BMIMain

## 🔄 Status
This repository is regularly updated with new exercises and improvements as I progress in my Java learning journey.
