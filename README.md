# Java Exercises ðŸš€

Repository with **Java learning exercises and mini-projects**.  
It contains practice tasks from my self-study, course projects, and small console applications.  

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build coding habits 
- Practice **Core Java** (syntax, OOP, collections, exceptions)
- Learn clean code structure and separation of logic
- Document my progress publicly 


## ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each exercise/project lives in its own folder
